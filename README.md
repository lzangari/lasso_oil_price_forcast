# Lasso Oil Price Forecast

The precise prediction of oil asset pricing returns is a complex endeavour due to the interwoven nature of numerous influencing factors. This research implements the \gls{lasso} regression model, providing an advantageous platform for efficient variable selection and accurate model forecasting. The model accounts for both constant and temporal variables, thus capturing the multifaceted dynamics of oil pricing. By counteracting the limitations associated with conventional regression models and illustrating the promise of the \gls{lasso} method, this research provides insights into oil asset pricing and return forecasting. The results indicate that when data is appropriately prepared, the \gls{lasso} model can surpass benchmark models like the no-change forecast and historical mean, due to its ability to select and assign importance to critical factors.
